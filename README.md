# Simple PHP API
A very simple API with Controllers and Actions created using pure PHP & Guzzle, PHP HTTP client.

The goal is to create a simple API and calling your own API instead of calling directly another endpoint in front-end.

In this way you are preventing the expose of API endpoints and the most important preventing the API_KEY, by storing it in back-end.
